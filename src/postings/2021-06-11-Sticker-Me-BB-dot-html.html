  <h2>STICKERS!</h2>
  <p>As you may have noticed, there are stickers on the site now! You may have been brought here by one of the three artists:</p>

  <p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/subsalient" target="_blank">subsalient</a> <span class="tag featured">✧ featured artist ✧</span></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/tipsheda" target="_blank">tipsheda</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/aprilonian" target="_blank">aprilonian (hehe)</a></li>
    </ul>

  </p>
  <p>
    You can download then for your pleasure! The three of us really wanted to also print these and send them to everyone interested and there is about 150 per sticker, so if we run out, I might have to start like an actual sticker club. It doesn't cost anything, and I'm not data mining your address, so get on the mailing list now freaking gosh dangit.

  <h2>GITHUB!</h2>
  <p>You also may have noticed a few changes to the site since last I updated, can you tell?</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/aprilonian/artsite" target="_blank">I got github set up</a> too! So now you can copy my ENTIRE WEBSTIE. Please use it, feel free to credit me or not. I'll be adding more comments to everything as I go. This website was orignially based on Zonelets, a cool as hell blogging setup, and since then I have expanded on that code, so if anything, keep the <a href='https://zonelets.net/' target="_blank">Zonelets</a> credit if you will.</p>

  <p>Now go play with those old toys!</p>
  
  <p>With love,</p>
