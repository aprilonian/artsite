  <p>Today was a day like any other, adding beautifully trival experiments to a little blog post called me:</p>
  
  <div id="experimentslistdiv" class="caption quoteblock"></div>

  <p>You'll see a brand new tab at the top called Experiments. There you can find the same list quoted here. This will be a showcase of several different places to exlore as I play around with threejs, music, or what-have-you. </p>

  <p>Now go play with those old toys!</p>
  
  <p>With love,</p>
