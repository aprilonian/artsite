  <p>Shown above is a simple scene implementing a test from a three.js example and combining it with another outline filter example. I'll be looking into fixing some weird scaling on the outline shader. My goal is to make some cool stand-alone pieces of 3D pixel art all in the browser yo.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, welcome to my "new" website! I've decided to keep things simple with hosting this time around and having been inspired by <a href='https://zonelets.net/'>Zonelets</a> I want to use this blog for whatever I well please.</p>
  <p>That means I'll be posting music, complaining about urban planning, photography, 3D art, doodles, website sterf, and whatever feels right. I think it's time for me to stop thinking about myself as a brand ambassador for whatever the fuck "my brand" is and just be human.</p> 
  <p>Thanks for stopping by friend!</p>
  
  <p>With love,</p>
