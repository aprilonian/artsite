  <h2 class="wavy" wavy-highlight-style="bubble" wavy-highlight-color="blue">STICKERS!</h2>
  <p>As you may have noticed, there are stickers on the site now! Forever stuck to your screen when you visit. They might never peel off! Maybe if you use soap but don't count on it.</p>
  <p>Come on, don't get mad, it's not like they'll be here forever or anything. One day the universe will come crashing to an end in the great heat death of the universe -- so for now, just enjoy them.</p>
  <p>Oh, you're not mad? Then I'm just overexaggerating. More than likely, you were brought here by one of these goblins and actually want stickers.</p>

    Also, the three of us really want to print these for anyone interested. There would be about 150 prints per sticker, so if enough of you are interested and we run out, we might have to start like an actual sticker club... *heavy breathing* ... 
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll print these because it'll be fun to share with friends, so it's gonna be free and I'll just mail them to where ever you are. <span class="emphasize">I'm</span> not data mining your stuff, but I am using google forms to get your pesky address, so DM me if you're looking to avoid google.

  <p>You also may have noticed a few changes to the site since last I updated, can you tell?</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/aprilonian/artsite" target="_blank">I got github set up</a> too! So now you can copy my ENTIRE WEBSTIE. Please use it, feel free to credit me or not. I'll be adding more comments to everything as I go. This website was orignially based on Zonelets, a cool as hell blogging setup, and since then I have expanded on that code, so if anything, keep the <a href='https://zonelets.net/' target="_blank">Zonelets</a> credit if you are interested in copy pasta'ing everything.</p>

  <p>If you want something a little less cluttered, I also stripped everything down to a template for an art blog also on <a href="https://github.com/aprilonian/artsite/tree/main/artplate" target="_blank">my github</a></p>

  <p>DM me on tweeter if you have any questions or get confused, because it is a mess to look at at first. Zonelets is certainly easier to get into if it's your first time diving into JavaScript, I would recommend it to anyone if you can't already tell.</p>
  
  <p>With love,</p>
